# Mapping loneliness in the UK
University of Bristol Interactive AI CDT first year module Applied Data Science. Repository contains my individual contribution to a group project to investigate loneliness in the UK. Background to the task available from the [University of Bristol - Jean Golding challenge][bristol].

I investigated whether school attainment and absence rates indicated loneliness. The data was obtained from the [government website][gov] and maps of England were produced showing regional disparity with statistical comparisons made with the [Loneliness Prescription Index][loneliness].
